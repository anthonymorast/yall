yall.pc.in - a file that helps with loading/linking the library when compiling
	- right now the executable must be compiled via 
		"g++ `pkg-config --cflags --libs yall` name.cxx"
	- pkg-config provides information stored in the yall.pc file (located somewhere on the disk)
	- after running the ldd command below I can build with just "g++ <name>.cxx -lYALL"

Linking Errors:
	- for a time I was getting the executable to build but it wouldn't execute since the 
	  linker couldn't find the libYALL.so.1 file. To fix this I ran "sudo ldconfig" and was
	  able to get the thing to run.
	- running "ldd <executable>" is a good way to debug this.
