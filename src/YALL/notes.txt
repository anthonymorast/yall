For a good idea of what a linux library should look like (including namespaces, headers, usage, etc.)
look at the SFML project. This is installed via 'sudo apt install libsfml-dev' on debian based systems
and resides by default (I believe) in /usr/include/SFML/ (sudo find / -name "SFML").

This library is made up of HPP files that show how to create and deploy a library as well as use a 
namespace.
