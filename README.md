# YALL (Yet Another Learning Library)

YALL is a C++ library that implements many machine learning algorithms and attempts not to use company or platform specific libraries. That is, 
the goal of YALL is to be readily usable on Windows, Linux, Mac, Raspberry Pi, etc. without a lot of installation and headaches. 

There are many great machine learning libraries out there that do many things, probably more efficiently than YALL. The primary purpose of this
library is for my own personal experience with a secondary purpose of being portable, useful, and efficient

An additional FYI, this is the first project I'm building using CMAKE. It's also acting as an introduction to this build system and enhancing my knowledge of linux linking/compiling. Excuse the note files all over the place...

+ C++11
    + The library will might work with older versions of C++ but I'm compiling my tests with
        --std=c++11
