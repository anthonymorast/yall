## THese will be included in the programs using our program

## Create the pkg-config file
configure_file(yall.pc.in yall.pc @ONLY)

## not 100% sure here
## A good way to thinkg of this is that we're adding the second part (after the PRIVATE/PUBLIC/etc.)
## as compiler flags in the Makefile with the first value as the target (YALL) which are just Makefile
## targets.
target_include_directories(YALL PRIVATE include)
target_include_directories(YALL PRIVATE src)

## e.g. add the flag -Wno-psabi to the Makefile target YALL

## Install the project shared library files and the PUBLIC HEADERS (files to be used by apps:).
install(TARGETS YALL 
	LIBRARY DESTINATION ${CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR}

## builc the .pc pkg-config file and move it
install(FILES ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/yall.pc
	DESTINATION ${CMAKE_INSTALL_DATAROOTDIR}/pkgconfig)

## Need to copy these files to the include directories to be includeed by the public headers.
